        <p class="mb-10">
            The kingdom of God is the good news that, in Jesus Christ, God’s long-awaited reign has arrived. Christ
            brings God’s story of creation and redemption to its fullness, inviting us out of the false kingdoms of
            self-rule and into the life God intended from the beginning. In his kingdom, we learn a new way of being
            human, because our King himself is restoring the world. This is the vision we dare to embrace: a community
            shaped by Christ, living under his rule, and joining in his mission to make all things new.

        <h2 class="text-2xl mt-10 mb-3">About the Speaker: Pastor Byung Ham</h2>
        <p>
            In 1980 Byung Ham was born in S. Korea, then, as an infant immigrated to Baltimore, MD. (He has also
            lived in Chicago, IL, Houston, TX and Atlanta, GA.)

            Without the saving grace of Jesus Christ, Byung used hip-hop, sports, and pleasure to find meaning in
            life. After trusting his life to the LORD, Byung believes that, "to live is Christ and to die is gain."
            He was trained and equipped at Washington Bible College and Capital Bible Seminary.

            This may be difficult to believe but Byung delivered his first sermon at the age of nineteen! He and
            Melanie are newlyweds and reside in Clarksville, Maryland.
