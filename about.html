        <h1 class="text-4xl mb-8">Why Kingdom Come?</h1>
        <p class="mb-10 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            The kingdom of God is the good news that, in Jesus Christ, God’s long-awaited reign has arrived.
            Christ brings God’s story of creation and redemption to its fullness, inviting us out of the false
            kingdoms of self-rule and into the life God intended from the beginning. In his kingdom, we learn
            a new way of being human, because our King himself is restoring the world. This is the vision we
            dare to embrace: a community shaped by Christ, living under his rule, and joining in his mission
            to make all things new.
        </p>

        <div class="space-y-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            <p>
                In 1980 Byung Ham was born in S. Korea, then, as an infant immigrated to Baltimore, MD.
                (He has also lived in Chicago, IL, Houston, TX and Atlanta, GA.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Without the saving grace of Jesus Christ, Byung used hip-hop, sports, and pleasure to find
                meaning in life. After trusting his life to the LORD, Byung believes that, "to live is Christ
                and to die is gain." He was trained and equipped at Washington Bible College and Capital Bible Seminary.
            </p>
            <p>
                This may be difficult to believe but Byung delivered his first sermon at the age of nineteen!
                He and Melanie are newlyweds and reside in Clarksville, Maryland.
            </p>
