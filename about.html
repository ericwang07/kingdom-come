        <p>
            The kingdom of God is the good news that, in Jesus Christ, God’s long-awaited reign has arrived. Christ
            brings God’s story of creation and redemption to its fullness, inviting us out of the false kingdoms of
            self-rule and into the life God intended from the beginning. In his kingdom, we learn a new way of being
            human, because our King himself is restoring the world. This is the vision we dare to embrace: a community
            shaped by Christ, living under his rule, and joining in his mission to make all things new.
